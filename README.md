## Running Performance Data Analysis

This application will run comparative data analysis between individuals' running data and past historical weather data.

Running data will be brought in via the Strava API which gathers different data points such as :

* Distance
* Time
* Speed
* Elevation
* Location

Weather data will be accessed via {{determine_later}} {{API or CSV}} to gather past weather data for past runs such as:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Percipitation
* Dewpoint
