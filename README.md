# RRGCC Running Data

I run weekly in the Red River Gorge, in particular I mainly run on Red River Gorge Climbers Colition ([RRGCC](https://rrgcc.org/)) owned and operated land, such as the Pendergrass-Muray Recreational Preserve ([PMRP](https://rrgcc.org/rrg-info/pmrp/)) and Bald Rock Recreational Preserve ([BRRP](https://rrgcc.org/rrg-info/brrp/)). These preserves are mainly used for rock climbing but host endless miles of trails for hiking and excellent trail running. To better showcase the trail running in the area I have acquired and processed data from Strava to collect a variety of running metrics to create a dashboard.

This dashboard will run comparative data analysis between individuals' running data in regards to past historical weather data acquired from [NOAA](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) and be presented in a dashboard to show analysis and routes to the runner.

### Running data

##### Strava API :

* Distance
* Time
* Speed
* Elevation
* Location
  * Google Polyline will be used to map routes and determine location for weather analysis.

### Weather data

NOAA historical weather data for the RRGCC areas in Lee County, KY

##### Weather station : Beattyville 4 N

* Temperature
  * Max, Minimium, and Average
* Precipitation
* Snowfall

##### Future Development

I would like to use Google Polyline drawings to develop an app for Local Search and Rescue efforts to better streamline response times to climbers in need.
