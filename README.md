# RRGCC Running Data

I run weekly in the Red River Gorge, in particular I mainly run on Red River Gorge Climbers Colition ([RRGCC](https://rrgcc.org/)) owned and operated land, such as the Pendergrass-Muray Recreational Preserve ([PMRP](https://rrgcc.org/rrg-info/pmrp/)) and Bald Rock Recreational Preserve ([BRRP](https://rrgcc.org/rrg-info/brrp/)). These preserves are mainly used for rock climbing but host endless miles of trails for hiking and excellent trail running. To better showcase the trail running in the area I have acquired and processed data from Strava to collect a variety of running metrics to create a dashboard.

This dashboard will run comparative data analysis between individuals' running data with regards to past historical weather data and be presented in a dashboard to show leaderboards for times.
